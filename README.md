[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mahoote/drunkyard-app/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/mahoote/drunkyard-app?branch=main)

_We are only collecting coverage from the `/src` folder as it's the only folder that contains logic.<br>
The `/app` folder is only for the UI and is not being tested.<br>
We might use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) at a later time to validate the UI._
